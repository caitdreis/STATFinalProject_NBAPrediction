## Proposal

Introduction
	The National Basketball Association (NBA) grossed almost five billion dollars in total revenue in the 2013-2014 season.1 A component of the steady increase in revenue has been the advanced tracking of players and ball possession during games through a technological service called SportVu. SportVu was first introduced in a small subset of NBA teams and rapidly expanded to cover all 30 teams during the 2013-2014 season.2  The SportVu data includes detailed information about the exact location of the ball on the court assessed 25 times per second resulting in over a million entries to the database per game.2 This advanced tracking has been cataloged and made available for public investigation. 

Approach
Objectives
The proposed project includes the following research questions:
What are the factors that are most predictive of a successful shot? Statistical approach: significance testing of predictor variables, model testing across linear methods. 
In the assessment of player salary based on shot prediction, can we identify players that are over or underpaid for their performance? Statistical approach: significance testing of predictor variables that are strengthen a model for predicting salary based on performance.
